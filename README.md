## print('Hello World! I'm Yuzy!') 👋

I'm **Yuzy Ayvri**, or just **Yuzy** for short. I'm a 15-year-old programmer with a strong interest in **computer science** and an aspiring **software engineer**. I've been passionate about programming— and computers as a whole— since childhood.

I'm an **honor student**, though I spend most my free time _coding_ or _self-studying_. But what exactly do I do other than these? I _read and write literature_. Any form works, honestly— _poems, essays, stories, novels..._ I love them all; and I also enjoy _playing video games_.

I started coding at age 10 through **Roblox**— though in **February 2026** I began serious self-study in **Python** and **computer science**. In the coming months, I also plan to learn **C++** and **JavaScript**.

Committing code— and my heart... to my _**Moon**_. 🌙

### Projects 💻
- My [**basic Python calculator**](https://github.com/yuzyayvri/basic-python-calculator), which is also my first ever Python project! I continuously update it the more I learn. I never add something unless I know I already have a grasp of what it does.
- My [**algorithms library**](https://github.com/yuzyayvri/algorithms), essentially my personal library for a bunch of algorithms— ones that I learn and write personally. So like my calculator, everything in the repository was learned and applied by me!
- My [**data structures collection**](https://github.com/yuzyayvri/data-structures), like my algorithms library, this is where I put data structures that I have learned and written myself.

These repos show my growth as a programmer! And of course, I have many more projects to make.
