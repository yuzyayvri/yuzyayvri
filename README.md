## print('Hello World! I'm Yuzy!') 👋

I'm Yuzy Ayvri, or just Yuzy for short. I'm a 15-year-old self-taught Python programmer, and an aspiring software engineer. I've been passionate about programming— and computers as a whole— since childhood.

I'm an honor student, though I spend most my freetime playing videogames, writing or reading literature, and... if you haven't guessed, coding.

I started taking Python seriously on the 8th of February, 2026— so I'm still deep in the process of learning. However, I started coding at 10 on Roblox.

Committing daily... to my Moon. 🌙

### Projects 💻
- My [basic Python calculator](https://github.com/yuzyayvri/basic-python-calculator), which is also my first ever Python project! I continuously update it the more I learn. I never add something unless I know I already have a grasp of what it does.
- My [algorithms library](https://github.com/yuzyayvri/algorithms), essentially my personal library for a bunch of algorithms— ones that I learn and write personally. So like my calculator, everything in the repository was learned and applied by me!

These repos show my growth as a programmer. I'm currently learning algorithms and data structures, and speaking of data structures— I will make a repository for that soon enough.

### Languages I Know 📜
Python, Luau _(Roblox's modified version of Lua)_, HTML, CSS
